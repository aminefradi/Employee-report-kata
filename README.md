# Employee-report-Kata
Employee report kata with TDD implementation in Java.

# Problem Description

The kata consists on building an employee management system of a local grocery store. The shop-owner wants to open the shop on Sunday and due to legal restrictions employees younger than 18 years are not allowed to work Sundays. The employee asks for a reporting feature so he can schedule work shifts. All employees are already stored somewhere and have the following properties:

- name: String (the name of the employee)

- age: int (the age in years of the employee)
